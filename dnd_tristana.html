          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>This system was created to make the game more interesting, and to help the DM guide the story, the player characters, and Tristana’s personal character development. The system serves the story, not the other way around. Feel free to fudge anything here to enrich the DnD experience. At its core, this webpage is a collection of guidelines to help you better understand and curate Tristana’s emotional and magical journey.</p>
          
          <h3>Who is Tristana?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Sentimental</li>
            <li>Emotional</li>
            <li>Fearful</li>
            <li>Oblivious</li>
            <li>Mom died during childbirth, and passed the curse on to Tristana</li>
            <li>Left the civilized world at age 8</li>
            <li>Grew up in the wild</li>
            <li>Developing Sense of Morality</li>
            <li>She's really just a normal girl with unfortunate circumstances. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Tristana's Relationship with Magic</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Tristana is afraid of her own magic – at a young age, she accidently killed her family.</li>
            <li>Tristana’s magic is the physical manifestation of her emotions. In moments of strong resolve, anger, fear, etc. Tristana <strong>will</strong> cast magic that is emotionally appropriate, even if she doesn’t want to.</li>
            <li>She is deathly afraid of her magic, but she isn’t <em>bad</em> at it. Her magic is destabilized by her fear and lack of practice. </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Emotional Magic Guidelines</h3>
          <p><strong>If Tristana is ever at all emotional, or wants something strongly, use this section instead of the general wild magic section</strong></p>
          <p>Whenever Tristana has a strong emotional reaction. She casts magic</p>
          

          <p>
            These are guidelines for example reactions. 
            
            Highly emotional moments (examples):
            
            Coming home and realizing her best friend was assassinated: 
              Despair – darkness. Black hole (suck in). Stamina drain to those around her. 
              Crying like crazy
            
            Watching the Big Bad kill her best friend in front of her:
              Anger – flame aura. 
            All damaging spells cast become fire element. 
            Extended reach/power of spells, but only targets the Big Bad. 
            
            Watching her best friend getting shot in the stomach and bleed out: 
              Healing tears 
            
            Party falling down a pitfall to their death:
              Panic – featherfall (or antigravity) on everyone
            
            Being level 1, and seeing a lv20 dragon:
              Fear – cast invisible on everyone (including dragon)
            Or randomly teleport party to random hiding spots around dragon. 
            Or cast petrify on self. 
              
            
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
